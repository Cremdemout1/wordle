# Wordle Game

## About

This is my first Python project, implementing a simple version of the Wordle game that runs on your terminal. The goal is to guess a random 5-letter word with feedback from each guess. This implementation does not limit you to 5 guesses.

## Features

- Selects a random 5-letter word from the system dictionary.
- Provides feedback: 
  - **Green**: Correct letter, correct position.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong position.
  - **No color**: Letter not in the word.
- After a game, you can choose to play again.
